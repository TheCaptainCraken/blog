Hi there! 👋  

My name is Pietro Agnoli, I have a deep passion for programming and love bringing creative ideas to life. Right now I'm studying Computer Science at [Politecnico di Milano](www.polimi.it).

My main interests include programming language design and implementation, salsa and bachata dancing, mixing cocktails, and about a billion other things that catch my attention. Oh, and I’m also learning Spanish—so if you’re a native speaker, feel free to test me out!  

## What is this thing?  

Whenever I meet someone new, I like to ask: *“What would you do if you had 10 million euros right now?”* It’s such a fun question because it tells you so much about someone—what they dream about, what they love, and what really makes them tick.  

If you ask me, my answer is simple: I’d move to an island with sandy beaches and palm trees and open *The Captain Kraken’s Tavern.* It would be a pirate-themed cocktail bar and kitchen. I’d be behind the bar, mixing up all the drinks. It’d be the kind of place where you can sip on something delicious, eat great food, and chat about fascinating things with people from all over the world—just like in a proper pirate tavern!  

Of course, as a student, I’m not exactly in a position to open my dream tavern right now. So I decided to build this website instead! Think of it as the virtual version of *The Captain Kraken’s Tavern*.  

Here, you’ll find:

- Cooking recipes 🥘  
- Drink recipes 🍹  
- Articles about topics I find interesting, like computer science, self-improvement, my life, the lives of people around me, or just… cool stuff worth sharing.  

Basically, it’s a little bit of everything.

## Cool, when are you posting this stuff?  

I’m aiming to post something new every week. Most of it will be articles (probably a 70/30 split between articles and recipes).  

That said, I’m a student, and my schedule revolves around exams. During exam periods, updates might be slower. I’ll do my best to keep things rolling.

## Conclusion  

I really hope you’ll find this tavern of mine interesting. If there’s something you’d love to see here—whether it’s a topic, a recipe, or just something cool you think others would enjoy—hit me up!
