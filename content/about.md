Hi there! 👋 My name is Pietro Agnoli and I'm a 20-year-old student of Computer Science at Politecnico di Milano in Italy. I have a passion for programming and love to create new and interesting things. My favourite programming languages are C, Python and Rust🦀.

When I'm not coding, you can find me mixing up cocktails🍸. In fact, I have a website where I share my best recipes: [Crakentail](https://crakentail.com/en). I also enjoy sailing and skateboarding, and I love to participate in programming competitions.

I first started programming in middle school, when I learned to program using [Kodu](https://www.kodugamelab.com/). Since then, I've been hooked. Currently, my favourite course at Politecnico di Milano is about algorithms and theoretical computer science. I enjoy exploring new concepts and applying them to simple yet interesting projects.

On this blog, I'll be sharing my programming projects with you. Thanks for visiting!
