A few months ago, I was in search of a new book and decided to explore the best sellers in the "self-help" category online. Among the recommendations, James Clear's "Atomic Habits" caught my eye, and given its popularity with over 15 million copies sold, I decided to give it a read. I found the book quite enjoyable.

## The Power of the Atomic Habit

The book strives to present a clear and proven method for developing positive habits and overcoming negative ones. It introduces the concept of an "atomic habit", stressing that **these are not merely small habits but are intricately integrated into a system**, akin to atoms forming molecules. The crucial aspect of successfully establishing or breaking a habit is to **start with small steps and gradually advance through a systematic approach** that propels one toward the desired outcome. This approach resonates with the perspective of Super Bowl winner [Bill Walsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Walsh_(American_football_coach)), who famously expressed, *"the score takes care of itself"*, emphasizing the notion that sustained effort leads to eventual success.

## How to Create a System

To build a habit one needs to create a system. There are four laws one must to follow:

1. [Make it Obvious](#make-it-obvious)
2. [Make it Attractive](#make-it-attractive)
3. [Make it Easy](#make-it-easy)
4. [Make it Satisfying](#make-is-satisfying)

If the desired outcome is to brake a habit, do the opposite:

1. Make it Invisible
2. Make it Unattractive
3. Make it Dificult
4. Make it Unsatisfying

### Make it Obvious

*Make it Obvious* involves **clearly stating your desires**. A practical approach is to document your intentions, such as specifying, *"I will (BEHAVIOR) at (TIME) in (PLACE)".* Another effective method is *habit stacking*: linking a new habit to one you already practice, like *"After (HABIT YOU ALREADY DO), I will (NEW HABIT)".* To break a habit, it's essential to raise awareness of the issue. One effective way is to compile a list of all your habits, enabling you to see on paper what needs to change. Additionally, minimizing exposure can help; for instance, if you're trying to quit smoking, reduce your time around cigarettes or other smokers.

### Make it Attractive

This concept is straightforward: **make your new habit appealing**. One effective technique is *temptation bundling*, where you pair the habit you want to adopt with something enjoyable. For instance, if you aim to make exercise a habit, consider listening to your favorite playlist exclusively during your workout sessions. Another way to enhance the attractiveness of an activity is to immerse yourself in a community where the behavior is commonplace. For example, if you're trying to exercise regularly, join a group of people who frequent the gym. This social conditioning makes the habit more attractive. Conversely, if you're looking to break a bad habit, make it *unattractive* by consistently reminding yourself of its drawbacks. For instance, if you're a smoker, place a poster about the dangers of cigarettes near your smoking area at home.

### Make it Easy

When discussing habits, there's a **common misconception that creating one requires significant effort**. However, this notion is misleading. Our natural tendency is to conserve energy, and it's not necessarily a negative trait; in fact, it's what propels our species to innovate. Investing sustained effort is challenging in the long run. A more effective approach to habit formation is **starting with a very small and manageable habit and gradually scaling it up**. For instance, if your goal is to incorporate piano practice into your routine, you might decide to sit down and play for just 2 minutes every day after dinner. This simplicity increases the likelihood of repetition. Additionally, you can shape your environment to facilitate the right choices. For example, if you want to eat less, consider using smaller plates; this makes it more challenging to consume large portions, naturally leading to reduced intake.

### Make is Satisfying

Our human nature tends to prioritize short-term rewards over long-term achievements, which often leads to the development of detrimental habits. For instance, smoking may provide an immediate sense of pleasure, but it poses health risks in the long run. Establishing positive habits requires **associating each repetition with a reward**. There are various ways to implement this. If you're a smoker, consider saving the money you would spend on cigarettes and treating yourself to a vacation at the end of the year. Another effective method is using a habit tracker; the satisfaction of visualizing your progress serves as a rewarding incentive.

## Final Toughts

I thoroughly enjoyed the valuable insights gained from reading this book. James Clear presents concepts with clarity, providing excellent examples and summaries that enhance understanding. I highly recomend this book to anyone striving to achieve remarkable goals. Building a habit isn't about strenght, it's about resilience and mastering the art of **always showing up**.
