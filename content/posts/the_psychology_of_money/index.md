Picture this: tomorrow, just when you're having launch, you get a call. You answer and a man on the other side tells you that you won some 1000000$. What would you do with it?

If you're like most people you probably answered "I'll buy a nice Ferrari" or "I'll have a nice luxury vacation" or maybe "I'll buy a boat". Deep down you know this isn't the best way to use your money to guarantee you a life of wealth. So why would you do that?

Why do we always see people that win the lottery end up broke? The answer is rather simple: they usually gamble it away. The real question is why would someone that got so lucky one time want to risk it all over again?

Let's try to answer this.

## No One's Crazy

>Your personal experiences with money make up maybe 0.00000001% of what's happened in the world. but maybe 80% of how you think the world works.

This is true for everything, not just for money related stuff. We all are the result of our lives. I'll give you a classical example: cars.
In Italy, where I live, there have been 3039 deaths occurred as a direct consequence of car accidents in 2023. In the same year, exactly 6 people died in plane crashes. Even accounting for the fact that more people go on cars than on planes, the difference is huge. Yet, you are likely more scared to go on a plane than on a car.

So no one's crazy, we just see the world from a different perspective based on our personal experiences. People who win the lottery, think they could do it again, after all it happened once, why can't it happen again? You probably don't agree with the reasoning but I can imagine why someone circumstance would think that.

After all we are all humans, this is why...

## Reasonable > Rational

> Aiming to be mostly reasonable works better than trying to be coldly rational.

We are all humans. For some reason, we sometimes forget about it. For this reason is unrealistic to aim to be coldly rational when thinking about our own investments.
You may be using the best investment strategy known to mankind but that does not mean you'll sleep well at night.

For this reason you should instead aim to be just *reasonable*. It means choosing the strategy you can best live with. In the U.S. the historical odds of making money in markets is about 50% in a day,
68% in a year and 100% in 20 years. That means if you stay long enough, you'll be making money. No matter what happens inb between.

If we need to stay in the game for long, a reasonable plan is no enough on its own. This is because, since you're human...

## You'll Change

> Long-term planning is harder than it seems because people's goals and desires change over time.

You maybe not aware of this al the time but you have change and you'll continue to do it forever.
What you wanted to do when you were a kid is very different from what you're doing now. It will be different than what you'll do in 20 years.

The solution is simple. You should always avoid extremes when making financial decisions. This will leave you room to change.
