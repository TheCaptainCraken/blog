Sangria is one of my favorite party drinks.  
You can make it the day before with fruits from your local supermarket, a nice bottle of wine, and it's guaranteed to impress everyone!  

## Ingredients  

These are my go-to ingredients, but they can change depending on the seasonality of the fruits.  
This recipe serves about 3 to 4 people.

## Procedure  

Here’s how I make it. The process isn’t super strict, but remember to start at least 12 hours before serving (24 hours is even better!).  

1. Put the sugar in a large bowl.  
2. Juice half of the lemons into the bowl.  
3. Dice the fruits into 1 cm cubes and add them to the bowl.  
4. Pour the wine into the bowl.  
5. Add the spices.  
6. Add the Cointreau.  
7. Mix until the sugar dissolves.  
8. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap.  
9. Refrigerate for at least 12 hours (24 hours is ideal).  
10. Just before serving, add the seltzer!  

## Serving  

To serve, first remove the spices, leaving only the fruit and wine.  
I like to take all the fruit out and put it in a separate bowl—this makes serving way easier.  

Now, add the seltzer to the infused wine. From here:

- Pour the wine into glasses.  
- Add some fruit from the separate bowl to each glass.  

Bonus points if you pour the wine into a jug before serving—it makes it much easier to handle!  

## Captain’s Tips  

Sangria is the kind of recipe you can tweak with whatever you have on hand. As long as you’ve got fruit, wine, sugar, and seltzer, you’re good to go.  

If you don’t have the exact fruits I used or the same quantities, don’t worry! For the wine, pick a nice full-bodied red. No seltzer? Use sparkling water instead.  

Serve sangria in red wine glasses, and for bonus flair, provide your guests with small sticks or toothpicks to pick out the fruit pieces from their glasses.  

Looking for a food pairing? Patatas bravas are my top recommendation—but honestly, anything goes.  

And that’s it! You’re now armed with everything you need for your next summer party or family gathering. You’re going to be amazing!
