Sangria is one of my favorite party drinks.
You can make it the day before with fruits you find in the local supermarket, a nice bottle of wine and its guaranteed to impress everyone!

## Ingredients

These are my go-to ingredients. Keep in mind they cna change based on the seasonality of the fruits.
This is a serving for about 3 or 4 people.

| Cannonau di Sardegna | 750 ml   | 3 cups                    |

| Seltz                | 400 ml   | 1.5 cups                  |

| Cloves               | 6        | 6                         |

## Procedure

This is how I make it. The procedure is not really that strict.
Just remember you need to start at least 12 hours before serving, best is 24.

1. Put the sugar in a large bowl.
2. Juice half of the lemons into the bowl.
3. Dice the fruits in 1cm cubes. Add them to the bowl.
4. Pour the wine into the bowl.
5. Add the spices.
6. Add the Cointreau.
7. Mix to dissolve the sugar.
8. Cover with plastic wrap.
9. Stick it in the fridge for at least 12 hours (best if you do it for 24 hours).
10. Before serving remember to add the seltz!

## Serving

To serve it, first remove the spices, leaving just the fruit and the wine.
Then I like to remove all the fruit and put it in another bowl. This will make it way easier to serve. In any case, now it's time to add the selz. After that you just:
Just pour the infused wine into a glass, then add some bit of fruit from the other bowl and you're done. Extra points if you first pour all the wine into a jug - this will make it easier to pour it.

## Captain's Tips

Sangria is the kind of recipe you can make with just about anything, you just need fruits, wine, sugar and seltz. That means if you don't have the exact same fruits I used or you don't have the same quantities, don't worry. If you can't get the same wine I used, try to find a nice full-bodied red wine. If you can't get your hands on some seltz, just use gassed water. The right glass for sangria is a red wine glass, it's nice to also give your guests a stick or toothpick to take pieces of fruit from their glass.

If you want to serve some food along with the sangria, my top recommendation is: patatas bravas. Anything can go really tho.

And with that, you're equipped for your next summer party or family gathering. You're going to be great!
