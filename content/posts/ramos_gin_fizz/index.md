## Procedure

Alright, roll up your sleeves, this is where the magic (and muscle) happens. Patience is your friend here.

1. **Combine (Almost) Everything:** Add all ingredients *except* the soda water into your cocktail shaker.
2. **Dry Shake:** Seal the shaker **without ice** and shake vigorously for a solid 2 minutes. Yes, *two minutes*. This emulsifies the egg white and cream, building the foundation for the foam. Your arms might complain, but push through!
3. **Wet Shake:** Now, add plenty of ice to the shaker. Seal it again and shake *hard* for another full minute until it's thoroughly chilled and even more frothy.
4. **Strain:** Double strain (using a Hawthorne and fine mesh strainer) into a chilled highball glass, leaving some space at the top.
5. **The Magic Rest:** This is crucial! Place the glass in the freezer for about 5 minutes. This helps the foam set.
6. **Soda Injection:** Carefully poke a hole in the center of the foam with a straw. Slowly pour the chilled soda water into the *center* of the drink. The foam should rise majestically above the rim of the glass without spilling over. That's the signature look!

## Serving

The Ramos Gin Fizz *is* its own garnish. The towering, stable foam is the star. Traditionally, a straw is placed straight up in the center ‚Äì if it stands tall without leaning on the glass, you've achieved peak foam structure! No need for fruit wedges or twists here.

## Captain's Tips

This cocktail is famously tricky, so don't get discouraged if your first attempt isn't perfect!

* **Shaking Power:** Seriously, don't underestimate the shaking needed. If you have a friend, take turns! It's a workout.
* **Foam Boost:** Struggling to get that thick foam? Try adding the spring from your Hawthorne strainer into the shaker during the *dry shake*. It acts as a whisk and really helps aeration.
* **Citrus Swap:** While the classic uses both lemon and lime, feel free to use 30ml (1 oz) of just one if that's what you have. Fresh is still non-negotiable, though!
* **Patience Pays Off:** The dry shake, wet shake, and freezer rest are all vital steps. Don't rush them!

## A Sip of History

Invented by Henry C. Ramos in New Orleans back in the late 1800s, this drink (originally the "New Orleans Fizz") became so popular that his bar reportedly needed teams of "shaker boys" working in shifts just to keep up with demand, especially during Mardi Gras!

And there you have it! You're now equipped to tackle one of the most iconic, challenging, and rewarding cocktails ever created. Good luck, have fun, and enjoy that magnificent fizz! You've earned it!
