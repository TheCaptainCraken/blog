As a third-year computer science student at Politecnico di Milano, I dedicate a considerable amount of time to deep thinking. So naturally, "Deep Work" by Cal Newport has piqued my interest because it promises to help people achieve depth more easily and it has favorable reviews on Amazon.

## Understanding Deep Work

The book aims to impart what it deems *"one of the most valuable skills in our economy"*, known as *Deep Work*. The author provides the following definition:

> Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.

In practical terms, any mentally demanding task that necessitates focused attention falls under the umbrella of *Deep Work*. Examples include:

- Practicing piano
- Studying for a test
- Writing a scientific article
- Solving a computer science problem
- Critiquing a poem

Such efforts are highly valued in today's economy because they are hard to replicate. The changing landscape of our economy emphasizes the inadequacy of average performance. Hiring multiple inexperienced developers cannot substitute the expertise of a highly skilled developer. Succeeding in this evolving economy requires the ability to produce at an elite level.

Mastering the skill of Deep Work can be challenging due to the lack of support in many work environments. Effective concentration demands a distraction-free setting. While the author cites emails as form of distraction, it is worth noting that, for my generation, prevalent distractions stem from social media apps such as Instagram, YouTube, BeReal, and the like.

## Shallow Work

In the book, *Shallow Work* is characterized as:

> Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend not to create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.

Examples of *Shallow Work* include:

- Reading and writing emails
- Cooking dinner
- Responding to messages
- Attending meetings
- Scheduling appointments

The impact of these efforts is lower than that of *Deep Work*. However, it's essential to recognize that eliminating *Shallow Work* entirely is not desirable; it constitutes a necessary aspect of daily life. The emphasis should instead be on minimizing the time allocated to these tasks in favor of engaging in more profound, meaningful work.

## Improve Your Deep Work

Within the pages of the book, Newport provides insights into improving one's capacity for deep work. This is a challenging exercise due to one's mind inclination to follow the path of least resistance, often leading to engagement in *Shallow Work* unless intentionally trained otherwise.

This challenge is exacerbated by contemporary work environments that do not prioritize depth. Open space offices, for instance, created with the intention of promoting open information sharing often end up hinder concentrated efforts, making it challenging to achieve and sustain depth. Many knowledge-based professions, characterized by intellectual effort rather than physical action, involve a significant amount of shallow work, with meetings and emails being major culprits. Furthermore, quantifying the impact of knowledge work, which often involves thinking and reflection, poses a considerable challenge.

To navigate these hurdles and cultivate deep work, consider the following tips:

- **Disconnect Strategically:** Dedicate a specific block of timeâ€”a day, a week, or even a monthâ€”to disconnect from all sources of shallowness.
- **Seize Opportunities for Depth:** Whenever you find yourself in a conducive environment, take advantage of the opportunity to engage in *Deep Work*.
- **Plan Your Day:** Utilize time-blocking apps or traditional planning methods to structure your day in advance.
- **Treat Time as a Limited Resource:** Recognize time as a valuable and finite asset, akin to money, and allocate it judiciously.

Engaging in *Deep Work* involves organizing your thoughts and remaining vigilant against looping and distractions. When grappling with a challenging problem, encountering obstacles is inevitable. In such instances, it's advisable to break down the obstacle into manageable sub-challenges, facilitating a more systematic approach to overcoming it. Additionally, it's important to be mindful of looping, a scenario where you find yourself repeatedly revisiting the same thoughts without making tangible progress on the problem at hand. This awareness allows you to redirect your focus and adopt more effective problem-solving strategies.

Another valuable recommendation is to significantly restrict the use of social media. These tools are often superfluous, diverting your attention without providing substantial returns. While they offer a means to connect with friends and stay updated on their activities, the price paid in terms of time and attention raises a crucial question: is this interaction truly indispensable? If your social media usage exceeds fifteen minutes daily, the answer is likely negative.

Many, myself included before delving into this book, justify social media as a form of mental rest. However, the reality is that such rest is unnecessary for the brain. Rest can be achieved by simply shifting activities to something different, allowing you to use your "resting" time for productive pursuits that yield tangible benefits. Consider setting a goal, outlining activities that contribute to its attainment, and then dedicating your free time to those meaningful endeavors.

## Conclusion

I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. The insights gained are invaluable, and I plan to implement the strategies learned in the upcoming semester. Many knowledge workers often find themselves ensnared in an unending cycle of seemingly futile meetings and emails, making this book a compelling read for individuals in knowledge-based professions.

While the primary target audience appears to be those in knowledge work, I believe the tips offered are universally applicable and beneficial, transcending specific occupations. As a university student, my experiences may differ slightly, given the lower frequency of meetings and minimal use of email. However, the overarching principles and strategies provided in the book remain highly relevant and useful for everyone.
