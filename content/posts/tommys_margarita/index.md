## Procedure

Alright, shaker at the ready! While it's not the marathon shake of the Ramos, precision is still your key to unlocking greatness here. Let's do this!

1. **Combine Ingredients:** Pour that glorious tequila, the *essential* fresh lime juice, and the golden agave syrup straight into your shaker.
2. **Ice It Up:** Fill your shaker about two-thirds full with good, solid ice. Don't use slushy ice!
3. **Shake Vigorously!** Seal it tight and shake like you mean it for a solid 20 seconds. Get it arctic cold! The shaker should be painfully frosty to the touch: that's how you know it's ready!
4. **Prepare the Glass:** Grab a chilled Old Fashioned glass. Run a lime wedge around the *outer* rim (key!) and gently roll it in coarse salt. Go on, you've earned that salty kiss!
5. **Strain:** Pop a big, beautiful ice cube (the bigger, the better for slow dilution!) or fresh cubes into your glass. Strain that luminous liquid gold from the shaker right over the ice. Look at that color!

## Serving

The Tommy's Margarita demands nothing more than the glass it's in. Served neat over ice, its garnish is elegantly minimal: a single lime wedge on the rim or dropped in. That's it. Its beauty is its stark, stunning simplicity and the vibrant glow of the drink itself. Pure class.

## Captain's Tips

This one might seem easy, but achieving perfection requires attention! Don't get complacent!

* **Tequila is Paramount:** Seriously, use a quality 100% agave Blanco. This isn't the place for that cheap stuff. The tequila *is* the drink! Let its true character sing!
* **Fresh Lime or Bust:** I cannot stress this enough: *DO NOT* use bottled lime juice. Ever.
* **Dial in the Agave:** That 20ml (0.75 oz)? It's your starting line, not the finish. Taste! Is your agave super sweet? Is your lime extra tart? Adjust by tiny increments until it makes *you* happy.
* **Salt Rim Mastery:** If you salt, keep it neat! *Outside rim only*. Nobody wants a mouthful of salt with every sip. A clean half-rim looks incredibly sharp.
* **The Shake Matters:** Even without egg, don't just give it a lazy wobble. A hard, fast shake chills, dilutes perfectly, and wakes everything up with a little aeration. Make it lively!

## A Sip of History

Forget dusty Mexican legends; this icon was born under the bright lights of San Francisco! The Tommy's Margarita isn't ancient history; it's a modern marvel with a story steeped in family pride and a deep, abiding love for tequila. Picture this: it's around 1990. **Julio Bermejo**, a true tequila apostle, is behind the bar at his family's legendary **Tommy's Mexican Restaurant**. Julio looked at the classic Margarita and thought, "We can do better. We can honour the agave!"

He felt the traditional orange liqueur, bless its heart, was just getting in the way, masking the beautiful, complex notes of the 100% agave tequila he championed. His revolutionary move? **Swap the Cointreau for agave nectar.** Pure genius! Using the sweetener from the *same plant* as the spirit? It created this incredible synergy, a direct line from field to glass. It allowed the tequila to step boldly into the spotlight, perfectly balanced by that essential lime zing. This wasn't just a recipe tweak; it was a statement! It championed quality tequila when it wasn't the rockstar spirit it is today. The drink became an underground sensation at Tommy's, passed along by bartenders and tequila lovers until it exploded onto the global scene. It stands as a towering testament to the idea that sometimes, stripping things down reveals true perfection.

And there you have it! You're now armed with the knowledge to create not just *a* Tommy's Margarita, but *your* perfect Tommy's Margarita. It's honest. It's vibrant. It's ridiculously delicious. Good luck, have fun, and prepare to taste tequila in a way you never thought possible. You might just have found your new religion! Cheers!
